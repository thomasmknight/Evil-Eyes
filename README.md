# Evil-Eyes
This page renders a pair of totally normal human eyes with no ulterior agenda and has them follow the cursor around the screen

## Usage
Move the mouse around the screen and don't look him directly in the eyes

## Future Updates
The next thing I'd like to add are more interactive elements of the face, such as eyelids and a moving mouth
